**Re: Technical Analyst (Economist) — Evidence for Development Impact and Innovation (EDI) Unit**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Technical Analyst (Economist) position within IFAD's Office of Development Effectiveness, specifically the Evidence for Development Impact and Innovation Unit. With 7+ years of progressively responsible experience in impact evaluation, agricultural economics research, and evidence generation across Asia and Africa, I can meaningfully contribute to IFAD's mission of turning evidence into transformative development impact.

**Evidence-Based Analysis and Development Impact**

At the heart of my career is a commitment to generating rigorous evidence that informs policy and drives development outcomes. As a Senior Research Associate at IPA, I oversee a large-scale panel survey tracking 15,000+ households across 500 rural communities in the Philippines, measuring socioeconomic development and program effectiveness. This work aligns with IFAD's focus on understanding what works in rural development and enabling evidence-based scaling of successful interventions.

I have independently conducted quantitative analysis on agricultural market dynamics, youth agribusiness profitability, and price fluctuation impacts. My publications in *The Journal of Development Studies*, *PLoS ONE*, and the *African Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics* demonstrate my ability to translate field research into peer-reviewed evidence advancing development knowledge.

**Technical Proficiency Across the Impact Evaluation Lifecycle**

My technical skills span development research methodology: RCT design and implementation, power analyses, SurveyCTO programming with advanced logic and real-time quality monitoring, and rigorous quantitative analysis using Stata and Python. I have supervised 100+ field staff while ensuring compliance with ethical standards and donor requirements.

My Master's in Economics (University of Malawi) provides strong grounding in quantitative methods. More importantly, field experience has taught me to adapt methodological rigor to implementation realities, a critical skill for the EDI Unit working across diverse country contexts. I pioneered WhatsApp-based survey feasibility studies, demonstrating technical flexibility and commitment to scalable solutions.

**Data Analysis, Knowledge Management, and Evidence Communication**

The EDI Unit's emphasis on data analysis, synthesis, and evidence communication is central to my professional identity. Through my consulting practice at AJ Impact Evaluation Consulting (aj-impact.com), I help organizations from grassroots NGOs to multilateral institutions access rigorous evaluation methodologies. This experience has refined my ability to synthesize complex technical information for diverse audiences, translate evidence into actionable policy recommendations, and communicate findings that resonate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

I have presented findings to donor committees, developed policy briefs, co-authored papers, and contributed to knowledge products informing organizational learning. My experience facilitating knowledge exchange across research institutions, governments, and development partners positions me well to strengthen IFAD's partnerships with centers of excellence, CGIAR, academia, and the private sector.

**Partnership Building and Multicultural Collaboration**

My international experience spans the Philippines, Malawi, and broader Asia-Africa contexts, providing cross-cultural competence essential for IFAD's global mandate. I have built partnerships with researchers, government officials, policy makers, and civil society across these regions. At IFPRI, I served as the primary agricultural market dynamics expert, facilitating knowledge exchange that secured future donor funding and shaped policy dialogue.

I am fluent in English at the highest professional level and bring exposure to multicultural development contexts. My commitment to capacity building reflects the collaborative approach essential for supporting IFAD's country-level objectives.

**Alignment with EDI Unit Priorities**

IFAD's vision of systematically integrating research findings, evidence-based innovations, and best practices into project design and implementation aligns deeply with my professional purpose. The EDI Unit's focus on generating knowledge through impact assessment and managing that knowledge for organizational learning represents the work I am most passionate about. My experience bridges these functions: generating rigorous evidence, synthesizing findings into policy-relevant insights, and supporting organizational learning.

**Conclusion**

This opportunity combines my technical expertise in development economics with my commitment to making evidence actionable for real-world outcomes. I am confident my ability to conduct rigorous analysis, manage complex research initiatives, communicate findings effectively, and build partnerships will enable me to excel as a Technical Analyst within the EDI Unit.

I am eager to contribute to IFAD's learning agenda and support the organization's evolution toward greater effectiveness. I am available for interviews at your convenience and can be reached at +63 927 644 2763 or aubreyjolex@gmail.com.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience and passion for evidence-driven development can contribute to IFAD's mission.

Yours sincerely,
