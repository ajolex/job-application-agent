**Re: Associate Research Manager Application**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Associate Research Manager position at IPA, driven by a demonstrated track record of managing complex research studies and a commitment to generating rigorous evidence that transforms development programs. As a current Senior Research Associate with extensive international experience in the country, I bring proven technical leadership, operational excellence, and the collaborative spirit essential for overseeing a diverse portfolio of research studies while strengthening country-level research capacity.

**Managing Complex Research Portfolios with Operational Excellence**

My experience directly aligns with the ARM's core mandate of overseeing multiple research studies while ensuring methodological rigor and operational compliance. At IPA Philippines, I led the [Philippines Socioeconomic Panel Survey](https://poverty-action.org/philippines-socioeconomic-panel-survey-psps), managing over 100 field staff across 500 communities and 15,000+ households—demonstrating my capacity to coordinate large-scale, multi-site data collection with rigorous quality assurance protocols. I currently oversee follow-up surveys for an [RCT examining ultra-poor livelihoods interventions](https://poverty-action.org/combining-cash-grants-with-ultra-poor-livelihoods-training-program-philippines) under Principal Investigator Dean Karlan, ensuring compliance with research protocols, ethical standards, and donor requirements while maintaining close PI coordination.

Additionally, I pioneered a feasibility study on WhatsApp-based surveys in the Philippines, showcasing my innovative approach to methodological challenges—a skill that translates directly to the ARM's responsibility for promoting best practices and adapting evaluation designs to diverse contexts. My prior contrintibution a study on measuring [the impact of aspirations interventions on psychosocial well-being](https://poverty-action.org/measuring-impact-aspirations-interventions-economic-and-psychosocial-well-being-philippines) further demonstrates my ability to manage technically complex studies that require both rigor and sensitivity to local implementation realities.

**Technical Leadership and Research Development**

My technical proficiency extends across the full research lifecycle. I have helped designed and implemented RCT protocols, conducted power analyses, programmed complex SurveyCTO instruments with advanced logic and validation, and delivered transparent data analysis in Stata, and now expanding to Python. I have supervised research teams, managed project finances, negotiated with survey respondents, and ensured timely delivery of high-quality outputs—all core competencies for the ARM role.

Beyond project execution, my 6+ peer-reviewed publications—including work in *The Journal of Development Studies*, *PLoS ONE*, and the *African Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics*—demonstrate my ability to translate field research into policy-relevant outputs that meet academic and donor standards. This publication record, combined with my Master's in Economics with specialization in quantitative methods and econometrics, positions me to serve as the technical lead for country programs while building staff capacity on complex methodological issues.

**Regional Coordination and Stakeholder Management**

My international experience spans the Philippines, and Malawi, providing me with the cross-cultural competence and internatioanl expertise essential for managing international projects. At IFPRI (2020-2022), I led agricultural price monitoring initiatives, briefed high-profile donor committees, co-authored policy briefs, and secured future funding through evidence-based presentations—demonstrating strong stakeholder communication skills. At IITA (2019-2020), I managed ICT and youth agribusiness research after winning a competitive grant, co-funded by IFAD-CARE.

These experiences have equipped me to prepare updates, progress reports, and presentations for PIs, donors, and IPA management while ensuring alignment between research design and operational implementation. I understand the complexities of managing procurement contracts, monitoring survey performance, and maintaining data security standards across diverse regulatory environments.

**Commitment to Capacity Building and Collaborative Partnership**

Throughout my career, I have prioritized knowledge transfer and team development. At IPA, I continuosly mentor my fellow research staff, help troubleshoot technical issues, and represented the organization in workshops. This commitment to help build research capacity aligns perfectly with the ARM's responsibility to promote best practices and develop staff technical competencies.

I am drawn to this position because it combines my passion for rigorous evaluation with my strengths in technical supervision, and collaborative partnership. I am confident that my proven ability to oversee complex research portfolios, ensure compliance with ethical and methodological standards, and foster strong relationships with PIs, donors, and survey partners will enable me to excel as an Associate Research Manager.

Available to start immediately, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to IPA's mission of generating evidence that transforms development programs. I can be reached at +63 927 644 2763 or via email at [ajolex@poverty-action.org](mailto:ajolex@poverty-action.org).

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to IPA's research excellence.

Yours sincerely,
