**Re: Senior Associate - Impact & Transformation (Internal Learning Workstream)**

Dear Hiring Manager,

If you asked me to describe myself in five adjectives, I would say: analytical, adaptive, structured, pragmatic, and strategic thinker. This matters for why I am writing to IDinsight today. My role is all about taking complex problems and evidence and turning them into solvable, actionable solutions. That's exactly what your internal learning workstream needs. You're asking: How do we learn faster? How do we make smarter decisions? How do we adapt when things change? I am someone who thrives on those questions. I stay adaptive, applying strategic thinking to help teams navigate uncertainty and refine direction as new insights emerge. I have spent years doing this externally for research institutions and nonprofits. Now I want to do it for IDinsight itself. I believe this makes me a strong fit for this role.

For the past 5 plus years, I have been building evidence systems that actually change how organizations, funders, implementers make decisions. At IPA, I co-designed and co-led implementation of a large-scale panel survey tracking 15,000+ households across 500 communities. At IFPRI, I led agricultural market analysis and presented findings to major donor committees in ways that shifted their priorities and secured future funding. These experiences taught me something important. The real value of evidence isn't in the data alone. It is also in whether it makes teams smarter and more adaptive.

That's why IDinsight appeals to me. You do this externally for your clients. Now I want to help you do it internally. I have seen (at IPA) firsthand how organizations that learn faster and adapt better create more impact. I want to be the person who helps IDinsight build the systems and insights that let you do that.

What I bring is probably more useful than just listing my credentials. I'm comfortable getting my hands dirty with methodology. Never will I compromise on methodology or consistency on what works. I have programmed complex surveys, conducted econometric analysis, and wrestled with data infrastructure. But I'm not a pure technician of course. I think strategically about problems. When something needs fixing, I ask: What's actually happening here? What are we assuming? What could we try differently? At IPA, I didn't just collect data on WhatsApp surveys; I questioned whether they could scale. At IFPRI, I didn't just report prices; I asked why those prices mattered for household welfare and presented it in ways donors could act on.

I'm also genuinely comfortable with the kinds of projects IDinsight values. Heterogeneous, ambiguous projects that require rapid learning. I have worked across agriculture, economic empowerment, and developement economics. I have managed large teams and mentored individuals. I have communicated with government officials, donors, academics, and field staff. None of that fluidity happened by accident. It came from staying flexible, asking good questions, and building structure where there's chaos.

**Why IDinsight specifically?**

I have followed your work and been impressed by your intellectual honesty about what evidence can and can't do, and your genuine commitment to making rigorous methods accessible, which is something thats seats right at the center of my heart.

I am ready to contribute immediately. I would appreciate the chance to discuss how my combination of technical depth, strategic thinking, and real experience translating evidence into organizational change can strengthen your internal learning work.

I am available whenever works for you: +63 927 644 2763 or aubreyjolex@gmail.com.

Thanks for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
